# 2D Lid-Driven Cavity FEM Solver

This project is a 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, simulating a lid-driven cavity at **Re=1000**.

The script programmatically generates a structured quadrilateral mesh using Gmsh, validates its quality (Jacobian and aspect ratio), and then solves the flow using a Q1/Q1 element formulation with **Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) stabilization**. Finally, it visualizes the resulting velocity and pressure fields.
