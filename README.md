# 2D-FEM-solver-using-GLS-for-N-S-Equations
This project is a 2D FEM solver for the Navier-Stokes equations, simulating a lid-driven cavity at $Re=1000$. It programmatically generates a structured quad mesh using Gmsh, validates its quality (Jacobian, aspect ratio), and then solves the flow using a Q1/Q1 element formulation with GLS stabilization.
